Librio Theme Modifications

This is a fork of the Wordpress Librio theme. It includes various modifications that I have made for the specific purpose of my site.

This includes, but is not necessarily limited to:

* A nice Apple background (the Aqua background from OS X 10.4)
* Overriding some CSS to make the WP-Syn-Highlight plugin look better.
* Added a wp_footer() call to enable admin bar support in Wordpress 3.1+
